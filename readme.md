## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. Click the Text Enhancer icon in your browser toolbar

3. Enter your API key (if required)
4. Click "Save Settings"

### Ollama Configuration

For local AI processing with Ollama:

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) on your computer
2. For best results, use smaller models (1B-3B parameters) for faster response times
3. Start Ollama with CORS enabled for the extension:
4. Set environment variable `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://*`
*You may need to kill all Ollama processes and then serve again; otherwise, you‚Äôll get an Ollama 403 error.*

6. For `"Unhinged Mode"`, install the uncensored model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull dolphin-phi:2.7b
   ```

4. In the popup, enter your instruction (e.g., "fix grammar", "sound more professional")
5. Press Enter or click "Enhance"
6. Your text will be transformed according to your instructions!

## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Why isn't the popup appearing when I press the shortcut?</b></summary>
Ensure you're focused on an editable text field. Some websites might override the keyboard shortcut with their own functionality. Try clicking inside the text field first.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I'm getting API errors when using OpenAI/Anthropic</b></summary>
Verify your API key is correct and hasn't expired. Also check that you have sufficient credits in your account.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Ollama returns a 403 error</b></summary>
Make sure you've correctly configured Ollama with CORS headers for the extension:

```
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*ollama*"} | Stop-Process -Force
set OLLAMA_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://* && ollama serve
```
